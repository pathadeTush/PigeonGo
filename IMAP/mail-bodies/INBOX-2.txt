We’re updating our Terms of Service <https://www.youtube.com/t/terms>  
(“Terms”) to improve readability and transparency. This update does not  
change the Google Privacy Policy <https://policies.google.com/privacy>, nor  
the way we collect and process your data.

We’ve provided a summary of key changes  
<https://www.youtube.com/t/terms?preview=20191210#summary> but here’s what  
you can expect:

• Terms that are clearer and easier to understand with useful links to help  
you navigate YouTube and better understand our policies.

• Expanded commitments to notify you about changes that may affect you,  
such as product updates or future changes to the Terms; and

• Better alignment between our Terms and how YouTube works today.

The new Terms will take effect on 10 December, 2019. Please make sure you  
read the updated Terms  
<https://www.youtube.com/t/terms?preview=20191210#main> carefully. If you  
would like more information, you can find additional information in our
